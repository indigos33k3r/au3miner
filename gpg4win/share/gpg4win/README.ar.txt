New in Gpg4win Version 2.3.3 (2016-08-18)

  1.6.6 to include a fix a problem with the random number generator.
  [CVE-2016-6313]. Details:
  https://lists.gnupg.org/pipermail/gnupg-announce/2016q3/000395.html

3. Known Bugs (and Workarounds)
===============================

- Using smart cards with Kleopatra:

   * OpenPGP card
     The initial setting of a smart card with Kleopatra is not yet
     possible. Please run the following steps once to use your smart
     card with Kleopatra.
     Use the gpg command line tool to create a new OpenPGP certificate
     on your card (a) or to activate your existing certificate of
     your card (b):

     (a) Create new certificate
       - Insert card.
       - Run "gpg --card-edit".
       - Switch to admin modus by enter: "admin".
       - Enter "generate" to create a new certificate.

     (b) Activate existing certificate of your card
       - Import associated (public) certificate of your card (e.g.
         from certificate server or from a exported certificate file).
       - Insert card.
       - Run "gpg --card-status".

   * X.509 Telesec Netkey 3 card
     Use Kleopatra to initialize your card:
     - Insert card.
     - Click on the flashing Kleopatra system tray icon (or use the 
       context menu "smart card" of the system tray icon and run the 
       "learn card" command directly).

   After finishing these steps your OpenPGP / X.509 certificate from your
   smart card is shown in Kleopatra under the tab "My certificates" 
   (marked with a smart card icon).

- Using the Outlook Plugin "GpgOL":

  * You defintely should create copies of your old encrypted/signed
    emails before installing GpgOL, e.g. in the form of PST files.

  * For Outlook 2003/2007 only:
    Sending signed or encrypted messages via an Exchange based account
    does not yet work.
    [see https://bugs.g10code.com/gnupg/issue1102]
    (Please note, using SMTP with GpgOL and Exchange seems to be work.
    Or use GpgOL with Outlook 2010/2013.)

  * For Outlook 2003/2007 only:
    Encrypted E-Mails occuring un-encrypted on the email server: It
    can happen that parts of encrypted emails are copied to your email
    server (IMAP or MAPI) in un-encrypted/decrypted form when creating
    or viewing them.  Affected is the content of the email view
    window, thus usually the so-called email body.  Attachments are
    not affected.  Switching off the Outlook preview will lower the
    probability of this to happen, but not eliminate the issue.
    Or use GpgOL with Outlook 2010/2013.

modified and that modifications may be distributed.  If the source
files (i.e. gpg4win-src-x.y.z.exe) are distributed along with the
binaries and the use of the GNU GPL has been pointed out, distribution
is in in all cases possible.
